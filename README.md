[LIR usage dashboard](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Aw3vmAqNNPIPiSPmBXv3OYscv8VlDwTBybyaw1RPpwY/edit#gid=701588566) - analytical tool to help you understand the usage of LinkedIn Recruiter in your team


[OR()_Builder](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qAEpdHipcYKm9b8VzQN72o-HjC_lCzGFIYp9c8P1LjE) - helps you to enter multiple keywords (such as Company names, Job titles, or First names) at once, and omit the standard Boolean restrictions on LinkedIn. Still the max entries is 748 values and it works only on **LinkedIn Recruiter**. But can do lots of heavy lifting if you need to browse multiple target companies, names or... the keywords around sustainability.
Many thanks to [Irina Shamaeva](https://booleanstrings.com/) who shared this tip on using **OR()** back in 2019 at SoSu in Tallinn, and to Josef Kadlec mentioning it later at the webinar called: [Legal Hacks on How to Overcome ALL Limitations of the Non-paid LinkedIn Account](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJIrDdrfVJM).
